PROJECT 1


ESCAPE PURGATORY

The player plays a cute ghost that is stuck in Purgatory.
Using the arrows keys, the goal is to avoid all the evil ghosts and reach a total of 5 dodges to win and move onto the after life (whatever that is).
BEWARE: with every dodge, the enemy ghost's speed will increase as well as its size!
