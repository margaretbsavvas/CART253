PROJECT 1


ESCAPE PURGATORY

The player plays a cute ghost that is stuck in Purgatory.

Press "ENTER" to begin game.

Using the arrow keys, the goal is to avoid all the evil ghosts and collect a total of 5 pink dust to win and move onto the after life (whatever that is).

BEWARE: with every dodge, the enemy ghost's speed will increase as well as its size!
